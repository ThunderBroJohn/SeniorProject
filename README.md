# Digital Assistant Jake
 A digital assistant meant to assist a user in productivity

Current working main file: Prototype1.py
   supporting files: modules.py, timerAndAlarm.py

Known bugs:
- Math module int division and mod division are having trouble
- bad commands default to "what time is it" instead of "I'm sorry, I don't understand that command"

Planned: Prototype 2 will feature bug fixes, and a speach trained sphynx python voice recognizer.
